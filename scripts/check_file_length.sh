# Thin delegate to the shared gate in ~/utils, which owns the cap and the
# exemption list (generated / vendored / data files). This repo previously ran
# a LOCAL check_file_length.py with its own higher limit, so it reported
# "gated" while permitting files every other repo rejects -- which is why its
# violations went untouched. Delegating is what stops that recurring.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check_file_length.sh <file> [<file> ...]   # pre-commit passes these
#   scripts/check_file_length.sh --all                 # whole tree, from cwd
